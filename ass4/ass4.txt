+ Question 1a

So we have eaves dropped on A and B and particularly noticed
B's response to A, we call B's response M' = M_eA.

Now we want to find M, so we contact A in a normal polite manner.
According to the protocol this will happen when we send M'.

1. C -> A:  {C, M'}_eA
2. A -> C:  M_eC

We now have M, as we wanted

+ Question 1b

This time we have eavesdropped on A's initial
sent message M'' = {A, M_eB}_eB

Now we start our attack which will consist of two communications
with B.

first:
        1. C -> B: {C, M''}_eB
        2. B -> C: {A, M_eB}_eC

        The replied value can be shown to be what
        I stated by dewrapping _eB from  M''.

second:
        From previous conversation we got {A, M_eB}_eC which
        gives us M_eB.

        Great, now we know M' = M_eB, so we can just
        continue in the same fashion as in 1a.
        
        1. C -> B: {C, M'}_eB
        2. B -> C: M'_eC

+ Question 2

Our goal is to impersonate A and communicate with B succesfully
so that he actually believes we are A.

Lets begin the attack

1. C -> B: {A, n_c}_eB     -- pretending to be A
2. B -> C: {n_c, n_b}_eA
    
    Ok, lets wait with 3. and instead initiate contact with A.
    This time however we pretend to be "n_c".
    
    What? Hold the phone! n_c is not a person! But we can choose
    n_c to be C, remember the nonce of C is chosen by C,
    and we choose it to be C! It will become clear why we do this.

    1. C -> A: {n_c, n_b}_eA     -- (the response of B)
    2. A -> C: {n_b, n_a}_e(n_c)

    From {n_b, n_a}_e(n_c) we easily can get n_b.
    Since n_c = C we can decrypt it and then we just
    throw away n_a.

    As for (3. C -> A) we just close that connection (dumping Alice :))

Ok, what did we get out from our "indented" communication?
Why n_b of course, now we just:

3. C -> B: {n_b}_eB     -- Note that we still pretend to be A

As B observed a reply from A that he thought only A could give,
B belives he is communicating with A but actually he is communicating
with C. The attack was successful.
