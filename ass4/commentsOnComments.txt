Hello Bart,

First of all, thanks for a very quick grading!

I Corrected my Q1, but as for Q2, I think your feedback
is not enough.

As for your feedback on Q2:

It's the first assumption in this course that the
adversary can intercept and block any message,
so of course if B sends to A we can choose to catch
the message ourselves (we are C).

Second, if I define n_C = C, you can say that it is
a wrong/impossible definition, but you can't grade
it as if I never made that definition! I refer to your comment

"No, n_c is not C! and you do not have the decryption key of n_c, d(n_c)
either."

The reason (I should have written it explicitly in my assignment)
I assumed n_c = C is a valid definition is: n_c is a nonce
which is a number, most representations of numbers has a defined
value for all bitstrings. That means the bitstring representation
for `person C` also has a meaning when representing a number.
That is my motivation why the definition n_c = C is not unlikely
to be possible.

Given all this, I would like to hear what more makes the attack
I presented incomplete. I don't really see any flaws with it now.

Now reading the hint, I see a completely different and less
powerful attack is expected.
(if you have invented something better than the
best known you know you've done wrong :))

Btw, I heard my colleague got "Accepted" from Luciano with the
same solution I had (we worked on Q2 together). But of course
I haven't seen his submission, maybe it was written completely
differently. So do you think I should resubmit with the intended
solution or is this different solution also accetable?

Best regards,

Arash Rouhani
